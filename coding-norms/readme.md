## Coding Norms and Terms


* **Functional Approach**: Break large functions into smaller sub units. Breaking down large functions into smaller, more manageable sub-functions helps improve code readability and maintainability. Each sub-function should have a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and test.
  
* **Naming conventions**: Name variables and functions according to its purpose . Use descriptive names for variables and functions that clearly indicate their purpose. This makes the code more intuitive and easier to understand, reducing the cognitive load for anyone reading or maintaining the code
  
* **No magic value**: Donâ€™t introduce any magic value. Declare a variables and assign value to it. Avoid using hard-coded values, often referred to as "magic numbers" or "magic values," directly in your code. Instead, declare variables with meaningful names to store these values. This enhances code clarity and makes it easier to update values in the future
  
* **Codding Principles**: SOLID, DRY, KISS
  
* **Readability**: Maintain code readability thus one can understand (Code for others). Write code that is easy to read and understand. This involves using consistent formatting, meaningful names, and clear logic. Remember that code is read more often than it is written, so optimize for readability.
  
* **Comment**: Try to avoid unnecessary comment in codebase.

* Code structure and pattern(modular/monolith/micro-service): 
* Error handling
* Global API response format
* Testing
* Logging
